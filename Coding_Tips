1. PyCharm

Accessing/committing project code
    -To CHECK OUT the code from github, go to the VCS menu and click on "Checkout from version control"
    -To UPDATE a currently cloned project, go to the VCS menu and click on "Update project"
        *This currently creates merging errors which Ricardo is looking into (9.18.12)

    -To comment out a section of code, highlight lines and push Ctrl+backslash
