1. Getting Started
    A. Windows
        * IPython:
            * Install Enthought for academics: http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php
            * Note: If you already have Python installed, you will need to uninstall it first (using the control panel),
              and delete the Python folders from your C drive.
            * Then, use the windows command line to navigate to the folder where you want to store the notebook data
              and type: ipython notebook --pylab inline
    B. Mac
    C. Unix/Linux
        *IPython included in package manager is too old to support notebook.
        Add "http://packages.debian.org/testing/python/" to sources list and install IPython 0.13+ and notebook from there
	* Git version included in package manager is too old to support current github, must install current version from source
